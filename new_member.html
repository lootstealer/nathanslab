                                <p>Welcome, after you are done reading this you should head over to the More Info tab and read are rules!
<br><br>Bad Boy's MGL is a clan for those that want to further their game, want to prove what they actually can do in war without a constant reminder of you need to do better or what do you call that. We the leaders will guide new members of the clan to success if they do not show us how to be successful of course. Can not teach a DR how to treat patients if you are only a nurse! But we will try are best to guide new members and at times new players to their goal of being the top of any clan they go to. We want to be the clan that makes you are breaks you. We do not want to be just another clan that bosses you around and tells you that you are no good. <br>
<br>We will work with any player no matter the difficulty. We can and will if asked teach you new troop combos and how to use them. We will put time and effort into all of our players. If we need to we record an attack combo to give you a visual of what we are saying. We are a team and teams must stick together to win. <br>
<br>We are a easy going war clan that likes to have fun. But everyone that joins must remember you are not guaranteed to have someone on at all times of the day. We all have day jobs, school, etc. But if you want or need someone on at that moment just shot a pm to one of the leaders preferably the leader of the clan. &nbsp;<br></p>

Becuase not everything that can be upgraded matters when it comes to war. Sure if everything was maxed it would make it easier in some ways but harder in other ways. We do not want to take the easy road though. So we look for good level players with a few stars on their profile.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Criteria is as follows!</u></strong></p><p>TH8 or higher (Can be negatiated)</p><p>Must have maxed troops for TH below</p><p>Defenses, maxed defenses for th below,</p><p>Must be atleast 18 way around this is by acting older than you are&nbsp;</p><p>For rushed players TH 8 or higher and you are not engineered, you will be asked to donate. As you will not be in many wars with the clan. Rushed players tend to throw wars off and we want to aviod that as much as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Engineered players are accepted on a few conditions, you must be able to 3 star bases above you. If you can not 3 star, 3 or more bases above you, than we ask you to start working on defenses or attacks. We can and will help the best we can with attacks if you ask.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u><br></u></strong></p><p><strong><u><br></u></strong></p></div>
